# Why this fork

In Tailor's original distribution, `stringifier-stream` in `objectMode`) enables the transmission of up to 16 elements in the buffer. It appears that Tailor is stuck in the parsing of elements, and nothing is being rendered.
Boosting the environment variable can facilitate the analysis of multiple objects, resulting in a memory boost.
